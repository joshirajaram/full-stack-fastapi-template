Please note that the exact changes to each endpoint are not specified in the DIFF, so the above table only reflects the endpoints that were mentioned in the patches. If there are any additional changes or updates, they should be included here as well.

To ensure consistency and accuracy, it's recommended to review the updated code in the `frontend/src/api-routes` directory to confirm the changes and updates made to the API endpoints. 

Additionally, the following sections may need to be updated based on the changes:

* Features list: If new features were added, they should be included in the features list.
* Installation: If new dependencies were added, they should be included in the installation instructions.
* Quickstart/Usage: If new commands or usage instructions were added, they should be included in the quickstart/usage section.

However, without more information about the specific changes made in the DIFF, it's difficult to provide more detailed updates.
